#What is MEGAGULP?
MEGAGULP is a collection of gulpfiles designed to give examples of how common gulp tasks can be written.
Each example is commented and is intended to be lean.
These examples should be used to look up a way to do something via gulp and should not be treated like a library.

##Where are the examples?

* **[cache-busting/](cache-busting/)** - tricks browser to avoid cache-check for templates
* **[clean/](clean/)** - cleans out a folder, usually preemptively
* **[concat/](concat/)** - concatinates files together to boost performance
* **[minify/](minify/)** - minifies code to boost performance
* **[rename/](rename/)** - helps you rename a file via gulp
* **[sass/](sass/)** - compiles your sass for you

Check out other examples in the [gulpfiles/ folder](gulpfiles/).
