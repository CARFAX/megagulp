  #What is MEGAGULP?
  MEGAGULP is a gulpfile designed to give examples of how common gulp tasks can
  be written. Each section is commented and is intended to be lean. This can
  be used to look up a way to do something via gulp and should be treated like
  a library.
  
  I can not stress enough that there is no reason to include this gulp file as
  your project's gulpfile. You should, however, be able to find & copy/paste 
  and certain tasks.
